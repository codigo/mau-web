## Senior Software Engineer

Jul 2015 - Jun 2018

### Technologies Used

- Microservices
- RabbitMQ
- AWS RDS
- Amazon S3
- Elasticsearch
- SQL
- MongoDB
- Redis
- React.js
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

In my role, I spearheaded the design and deployment of a microservices architecture to synchronize user data across multiple platforms and devices, significantly improving data consistency by 95% and reducing sync time by 60%. I implemented Elasticsearch as the primary search engine, which resulted in a 70% improvement in search speed and accuracy for user health data retrieval. Additionally, I developed and optimized a centralized ReactJS application for visualizing user health data, increasing other parties interests in the consumption of health data through humanapi by 60%. One of my key achievements was engineering automated testing solutions that boosted code coverage from 65% to 92% for both front-end and back-end services, leading to a remarkable 75% reduction in post-deployment bugs.

- Increased user retention by 25% and reduced customer support inquiries by 40%
- Streamlined reporting process, reducing manual effort by 80% and enabling real-time data sharing
- Reduced environment setup time by 90%, enabling 20+ developers and product team members to work efficiently without backend dependencies

### Technical Skills Showcase

- Leveraged Elasticsearch to create a robust search infrastructure, handling complex queries across 10+ data types and improving search relevance by 70%.
- Implemented comprehensive metrics instrumentation throughout the stack using Prometheus and Grafana, enabling real-time monitoring and reducing system downtime by 85%.
- Integrated various wellness APIs and clinical data sources, including HumanAPI, processing and normalizing data from 15+ external providers.

This role significantly enhanced my expertise in microservices architecture, advanced front-end development with ReactJS, DevOps practices, data integration, search optimization, and automated testing. It prepared me for more complex challenges and leadership roles in future projects.
