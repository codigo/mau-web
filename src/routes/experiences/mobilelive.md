**Software Engineering Consultant**

As a Software Consultant at Mobilelive, I guided a client in adopting a micro front-end architecture to address organizational challenges and improve the developer experience. We developed a specialized library called 'bolsterJS' (https://github.com/mobilelive-inc/bolsterjs), which removed boilerplate code for setting up micro-frontends, enhancing development efficiency.

Using bolsterJS improved the client's architectural scalability, allowing independent deployment and iterative development of each micro front-end. BolsterJS streamlined its development operations and fostered a more flexible and modular coding environment.

Throughout this engagement, I developed valuable skills in micro front-end architecture, library development, and software consultancy. My work at Mobilelive highlighted the importance of tailored software solutions in addressing specific organizational needs and enhancing the developer experience.
