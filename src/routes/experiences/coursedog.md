At Coursedog, my role involves analyzing university requirements to design and develop new integration solutions using Node.js. I write clean, efficient, and well-documented code for new integrations, adhering to best practices in software development. I thoroughly test newly developed integrations to ensure functionality, reliability, and compatibility with existing systems. I regularly review and update existing integrations with external universities' systems to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

My problem-solving skills, combined with my expertise in TypeScript and SQL, enable me to develop robust integration solutions that meet the complex needs of educational institutions.
