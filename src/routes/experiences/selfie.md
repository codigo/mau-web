At Selfie, I led the design, planning, execution, and deployment of 5+ microservices. My work included integrating Twilio API for two-factor authentication, which improved user security by 40%. I implemented MongoDB for data storage, handling 1M+ daily user interactions, and utilized Redis for caching user timelines, reducing load times by 60%. By employing ZeroMQ and REST for inter-service communication, I enhanced scalability by 3x.

## Major Projects Developed

- Implemented CDN and nginx for storage, improving media delivery speed by 70%
- Developed asynchronous upload system, reducing user wait times by 50%
- Processed 10,000+ daily media uploads for faster streaming and compression

### APNS Receiver

- Utilized socket.io for long polling and managing push notifications to Apple devices
- Implemented round-robin notification system, adhering to APNS rate limits
- Reduced notification failures by 90% through queue-based processing

### Capistrano Deployer

- Automated deployments of 5+ services
- Integrated with in-house build testing service
- Reduced deployment time by 75% and human error by 95%

### Ciruela (Continuous Integration Server)

- Implemented automated testing for all microservices
- Provided real-time coverage reports and issue notifications
- Improved code quality by catching 30% more bugs before production

### Scaler

- Developed automated scaling system for Joyent's Infrastructure
- Implemented backoff algorithm for efficient resource allocation
- Reduced infrastructure costs by 25% while maintaining performance

This role significantly enhanced my expertise in microservices architecture, API development, full-stack engineering, cloud infrastructure management, and continuous integration and deployment. The diverse range of projects and technologies I worked with contributed substantially to my professional growth, equipping me with a comprehensive skill set in modern software development practices.
