## Software Engineer

Apr 2022 - Mar 2023

### Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- React.js
- Material-UI
- Storybook
- Jest
- React-Query
- React Context API
- GitHub Apps
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Docker

As a Software Engineer at doc.ai (later acquired by Sharecare), I spearheaded the development of a distributed health study application, leveraging React, TypeScript, and Material-UI. I implemented robust state management solutions, established comprehensive testing protocols, and contributed to the architectural design of a scalable, responsive web application for health data collection and analysis.

- Created a reusable component library with Storybook, ensuring consistency across 5 different projects
- Implemented test-driven development practices, increasing test coverage from 80% to 95% and reducing post-release bugs by 70%
- Optimized application performance, improving load times by 40% and reducing API call frequency by 50% through efficient use of react-query
- Architected a robust front-end using React and TypeScript, implementing advanced patterns like custom hooks and higher-order components
- Utilized react-query and React Context to create an efficient data synchronization system, reducing data fetching errors by 80%

Through this role, I significantly enhanced my expertise in React ecosystem technologies, state management strategies, and test-driven development practices. I also gained valuable experience in healthcare technology, data privacy considerations, and creating user-centric interfaces for diverse populations.
