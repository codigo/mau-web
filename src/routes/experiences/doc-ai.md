At doc.ai, which later became part of Sharecare, my primary focus was on developing a distributed health study application. This application was built using React, Material-UI as a design system, Storybook for component testing, and Jest for functionality testing, ensuring the software's robustness and reliability.

To optimize data fetching and state management, we utilized react-query and React Context. This architecture facilitated efficient data synchronization, making the app more responsive and user-friendly. Moreover, TypeScript was employed throughout the project, contributing to safer code by enforcing static typing and reducing runtime errors.

The application aimed to collect and analyze health data across a wide distribution, contributing to more extensive studies and improving overall understanding of the health sector. Through this experience, I honed my React, TypeScript, state management, and test-driven development skills while contributing to a project with significant real-world implications.

My role at doc.ai and Sharecare reaffirmed the impact of precise front-end development in creating intuitive, robust applications. They demonstrated how anyone can use technology to contribute meaningfully to healthcare research.
