At Diligent, my primary responsibilities were maintaining and enhancing existing JavaScript code. Tasked with optimizing the performance and reliability of several applications, I leveraged my deep understanding of JavaScript and Node.js to identify and fix bugs, improve code quality, and implement new features where required.

A crucial part of my role was providing contextual insights into the Node.js applications to the rest of the team; this involved explaining complex technical concepts in an accessible manner, ensuring a clear understanding of the software architecture, and guiding developers in troubleshooting and problem-solving.

I maintained high code quality and readability standards through diligent code reviews and documentation. I also played an instrumental role in fostering knowledge sharing within the team, strengthening our collective expertise and efficiency in Node.js development.

This experience further honed my skills in JavaScript and Node.js. It underscored the importance of clear communication, teamwork, and continuous learning in maintaining and enhancing complex software applications.
