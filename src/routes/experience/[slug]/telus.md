**Sr Technology Architect**

**Apr 2019 - Sep 2020**

**Technologies Used:** Webpack, APIs, AWS, JavaScript, GCP, PostgreSQL, Node.js, React.js, Tap, Jest, SQL

As a critical Telus Platform Tooling Team member, I enhanced development practices by creating a Fastify-based Node.js framework for easy cloud deployment. We used GitHub Actions, Google Cloud APIs, and Kubernetes to streamline deployment processes.

Fastify's plugin-based architecture allowed for extensible development through plugin composition. We established best practices using nock.js and node-tap, creating a library of infrastructure mocks for testing.

We integrated secret management through Vault, making secrets accessible within the runtime process environment. This experience gave me valuable cross-functional collaboration, platform tooling, and framework development expertise.
