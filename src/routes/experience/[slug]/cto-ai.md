At CTO.ai, I focused on fostering a collaborative environment for developers by designing, maintaining, and creating APIs. We leveraged GitHub API to provide developers with DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics, streamlining the development process and improving productivity.

Alongside a dedicated team, I contributed to a project aimed at providing comprehensive performance analysis. By deploying pods into Kubernetes, we captured performance metrics such as network latency and memory consumption, using a custom sidecar to relay data.

This initiative gave developers a holistic understanding of their application's performance, enabling them to optimize effectively. My tenure at CTO.ai honed my skills in API development, collaborative software development, performance monitoring, and metrics collection.
