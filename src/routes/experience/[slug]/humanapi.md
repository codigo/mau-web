**Senior Software Engineer**

**Jul 2015 - Jun 2018**

**Technologies Used:** Webpack, Microservices, RabbitMQ, AWS RDS, Amazon S3, Elasticsearch, SQL

I was part of a team that designed and deployed microservices to retrieve and synchronize user data from various platforms and devices. Integrated Elasticsearch as the primary search engine and implemented metrics instrumentation throughout the stack.

I also helped Develop an application using ReactJS to centralize all user health data for visualization. I added Automated tests to increase code coverage for front-end and back-end services.
