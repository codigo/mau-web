**Principal Software Engineer**

**May 2013 - Jul 2015**

**Technologies Used:**

- Microservices

- Node.js
- Redis
- Apple Notification Service
- Twilio
- ZeroMQ

I led the design, planning, execution, and deployment of various microservices. I integrated Twilio API for two-factor authentication, using MongoDB for data storage and Redis for caching user timelines. We used ZeroMQ and REST for inter-service communication, ensuring efficient scalability.

I also developed several sub-projects, including:

**Media Handler:** Managed and validated all media received by the API, storing it via CDN and nginx.

**APNS Receiver:** Used socket.io for long polling and managing push notifications to Apple devices.

**Capistrano Deployer:** Automated deployments of various services.

**Ciruela:** A continuous integration server that ran tests and reported coverage and issues.

**Scaler:** Automated spawning of new machines using Joyent's Infrastructure based on HAproxy stats.

This role enhanced my microservices, API development, and full-stack engineering expertise, contributing significantly to my professional growth.
