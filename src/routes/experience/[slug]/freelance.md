**Technologies Used:** AWS, Redis, Amazon S3, Google charts, Heroku, Google Maps.

As a freelance software engineer, I worked on a variety of projects that allowed me to apply my skills in development, problem-solving, and project management. One of the key projects was Squadrapp, where I created an application to facilitate soccer game setups which involved using Amazon S3 for profile image uploads, setting up Redis for background email tasks, and deploying the application to Heroku. I also utilized CoffeeScript and AJAX for dynamic page updates.

I developed a web application to aid school coordinators in automating administrative tasks for college and university assistants. This web application included scheduling interviews, managing class schedules, and tracking student progress. I used Gravatar for profile images, Google Charts API for data visualization, and set up HTML email sending with Resque jobs for background processing.

In addition to these projects, I worked on several smaller applications, such as EzRent, which used Google Maps and Foursquare APIs to help users find rental properties near points of interest. For ctcMe, a contact manager, I developed a directory application with Twitter integration for profile images. For feed a Twitter feed collector for marketing purposes, I created a simple tool to retrieve and organize Twitter feeds by date.

One of my notable freelance projects was for the Coca-Cola Documentation Projects Portal in Colombia. I developed a project tasks view with colour indicators, created a new entry section with WYSIWYG, and added features such as user access limitations, activity streams, file uploads, private messaging, and email notifications. This project improved the company's internal documentation and communication processes.

Lastly, at Joyeria Caribe, I customized Satchmo product and discount classes, implemented multilanguage capabilities, and integrated Django Filebrowser with TinyMCE for rich text editing. I also automated SQL migrations with South, used sorl-thumbnail for image handling, and imported an extensive product database using Python scripts and SQLite.

My freelance work has allowed me to develop a diverse skill set and gain experience in various technologies, enhancing my ability to deliver high-quality software solutions.
